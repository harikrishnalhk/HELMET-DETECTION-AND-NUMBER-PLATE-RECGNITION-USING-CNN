# HELMET-DETECTION-AND-NUMBER-PLATE-RECGNITION-USING-CNN
The system automates detecting motorcycle riders without helmets and extracts license plate numbers using deep learning. It employs YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 for object detection (riders, vehicles, helmets) and OCR for plate recognition. This efficient, video-based solution enhances traffic regulation and road safety in India.
